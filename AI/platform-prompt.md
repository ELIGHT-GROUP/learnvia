* **Type:** Interactive learning platform (like Udemy or IBM SkillBuild), but **not just video-based**. Focuses on **reading, understanding, practicing, and testing**.
* **Target Audience:** University students (your brothers and sisters) mainly studying **software engineering**.
* **Learning Flow:**

  1. Users **sign up** and **enroll** in courses.
  2. Each course has a **structured sequence of content**:

     * Notes to read
     * Scrollable videos
     * MCQs to test understanding
     * Flashcards for memorization
  3. Users **complete a chapter** and click a **“check-in” button** to mark progress and move to the next subtopic.
* **Goal:** Not just watching content, but **actively learning and testing knowledge**.
* **Example Course:** “Java OOP”

### Platform Thoughts

1. The platform is more like a **learning experience platform** than a traditional course platform. It emphasizes **active learning, interactive content, and mastery tracking**.
2. This is very feasible, but it will require careful structuring of:

   * **Course content types** (notes, videos, MCQs, flashcards)
   * **Progress tracking system** (to know where the user left off, what’s completed)
   * **Front-end design** (to allow scrolling, interacting with content, taking quizzes, checking in)
3. From a prompt perspective for an AI tool, you need to clearly explain:

   * Target audience
   * Learning flow and content types
   * Platform goals (interactive, not just passive learning)
   * Example course(s)
